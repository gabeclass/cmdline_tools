# Exercise: Jumble descrambler

Every Linux system has a file (usually `/usr/share/dict/words`) that contains (almost) every word in English, one word per line.
**Challenge** -- using `grep` and regular expressions, write a short one-liner that can unscramble a word in those Jumble puzzles you see in the newspaper, like the ones [here]](https://puzzles.usatoday.com/jumble/).

It doesn't have to be a universal one-liner that would work for any scramble.  Rather, given a scramble, write a `grep` one-liner that can unscramble it, using the aforementioned `words` file.
